// ============================================================================
//  Input frontend — overview
//
//  The single hardware button feeds a producer/consumer pipeline:
//
//      btnISR()        -->  ring buffer  -->  ButtonState::poll()
//      (producer, IRQ)      (s_btnQ, 64 slots)  (consumer, called from loop)
//
//  Why a queue at all?
//    The ISR runs on every electrical edge — within microseconds. The
//    consumer only runs from `loop()`, which can block 200-300ms during an
//    e-ink redraw. Without buffering, edges that fall inside a redraw are
//    lost. With buffering, the ISR captures WHEN (uint32_t ms via
//    esp_timer_get_time/1000) and WHAT (pressed=true / released=false) and
//    returns; the consumer interprets them when it can.
//
//  Ring buffer (s_btnQ, declared just above):
//    s_btnQ.state[BTN_Q]    parallel slot arrays. one slot = (state, timeMs).
//    s_btnQ.timeMs[BTN_Q]   BTN_Q = 64 — plenty for any realistic click burst.
//    s_btnQ.head            producer cursor. ISR writes here, then advances.
//    s_btnQ.tail            consumer cursor. poll() reads here, then advances.
//    empty:  head == tail
//    full:   (head + 1) % BTN_Q == tail
//    s_btnQ.isrDropCount      bumped when the ISR overruns tail (see below).
//
//  Atomicity:
//    head/tail are single-byte volatiles; on ESP32-S3 a byte write is
//    atomic, so the ISR can advance head without a lock and the consumer
//    can snapshot head without a lock. The consumer DOES wrap "read slot +
//    advance tail" in noInterrupts() so it sees a coherent (state, time,
//    tail) trio even if the ISR fires mid-drain.
//
//  Overflow policy:
//    If the buffer is full when the ISR fires, the ISR drops the NEW edge
//    (bumps s_btnQ.isrDropCount, returns without advancing head). Tail
//    belongs to ButtonState::poll() and the ISR must not touch it — moving
//    tail from an interrupt would race poll()'s read-then-advance and
//    either deliver events out of order or corrupt the ring's invariants.
//    The main loop watches s_btnQ.isrDropCount; once it crosses
//    BTN_QUEUE_RECOVER_THRESHOLD (= 10) it calls clearButtonQueue() +
//    g_btns.resetState() on the theory that something is wrong (stuck pin,
//    bouncy contact) and the current click sequence is junk anyway.
//    Dropping NEW edges is less ideal than dropping OLD ones (the user
//    loses the most recent input), but the only safe place to drop old
//    edges from is the consumer side; doing it from the producer was the
//    race this fix removes.
//
//  IRAM_ATTR on btnISR: required so the ISR can execute even while the
//  flash cache is invalidated (e.g., during a LittleFS write).
//
//  Why store edge TIMES, not just sequence?
//    Debounce and click classification both reason about ELAPSED ms between
//    edges. If poll() is delayed by a long redraw, the original edge times
//    survive in the queue — we don't confuse "edges happened close together"
//    with "we got around to handling them close together".
//
//  Walked-through example — clean short click around t = 1000:
//
//    t=1000: press.    ISR queues (true,  1000),  head++
//    t=1080: release.  ISR queues (false, 1080),  head++
//    t~1090: loop() -> poll():
//      snapshot head, drain (tail..head):
//        (true, 1000):  debounce OK, transition -> pressStart=1000, armed
//        (false, 1080): debounce OK, transition -> dur=80 < LONG_MS,
//                                                  clickCount=1, lastRelease=1080
//      trailing-silence check: now-lastRelease = 1090-1080 = 10 < MAX_CLICK_GAP_MS.
//      Do NOT emit yet — could still become a double.
//    t=1100..1400: poll() called each loop, queue empty, still waiting.
//    t~1400: poll(): now-lastRelease = 1400-1080 = 320 > MAX_CLICK_GAP_MS.
//            -> shortClick = true for ONE poll, consumed by the screen.
//
//  Walked-through example — bouncy release:
//
//    t=1000: press.                      ISR: (true,  1000)
//    t=1080: real release.               ISR: (false, 1080)
//    t=1083: contact bounces closed.     ISR: (true,  1083)
//    t=1087: bounce settles open.        ISR: (false, 1087)
//    poll() drains:
//      (true,  1000): accept            -> stablePressed=true, pressStart=1000
//      (false, 1080): 1080-1000=80 > DEBOUNCE_MS=14, accept release
//      (true,  1083): 1083-1080=3   <= DEBOUNCE_MS, reject
//      (false, 1087): 1087-1080=7   <= DEBOUNCE_MS, reject
//    Result: clean clickCount = 1, no spurious double-click.
//
//  Walked-through example — ISR overflow during a long redraw:
//
//    Reader full-refresh page render takes ~300ms. User panic-mashes the
//    button 70 times while it's drawing.
//      Edges 1..63 fill the buffer.
//      Edge 64 fills the last free slot (head wraps to one before tail).
//      Edge 65 onward: the ISR sees buffer full -> bumps s_btnQ.isrDropCount
//        and returns. Edges 1..64 stay in the buffer; new edges are lost.
//    Redraw finishes; loop() iterates. It reads s_btnQ.isrDropCount, sees it >
//    BTN_QUEUE_RECOVER_THRESHOLD, calls clearButtonQueue() + resetState().
//    The mash is discarded; the next intentional press starts cleanly.
//
//  Walked-through example — ISR fires DURING poll()'s drain:
//
//    poll() snapshots head=12 at t=2000 and starts draining slots 5..11.
//    At t=2005 the ISR fires and writes slot 12, head becomes 13.
//    poll() doesn't see slot 12 this iteration — it's iterating against the
//    snapshot. That edge is picked up by the NEXT poll() call, which
//    re-snapshots head. Worst-case latency: one loop iteration.

//
// The classifier is awkward for one reason: the meaning of a click depends
// on what comes AFTER it. A short click is only a short click once enough
// silence has passed to rule out a double. So we have three emit points:
//   1. Inside the drain loop, on a release whose duration >= LONG_MS —
//      defensive fallback; in normal operation point 2 fires first.
//   2. After the drain loop, when stablePressed_ AND pressArmed_ AND the
//      hold has crossed LONG_MS — fires the long-click while the button
//      is still held, so the user gets feedback at the threshold instead
//      of after release. Sets pressArmed_=false to make the eventual
//      release a no-op (the release path's `if (pressArmed_)` guard skips).
//   3. After the drain loop, when a click sequence (short/double/triple)
//      has settled past its trailing-silence window.
//
// State that persists across calls — defined in input.h on ButtonState.
// Trailing-underscore names are member variables (vs. locals).
//   stablePressed_       last accepted physical state (true = pressed)
//   lastStableChange_    edge-time of last accepted transition (debounce ref)
//   pressStart_          edge-time of the current press's down-edge
//   pressArmed_          has this press not yet produced an event?
//                        true between press and the event it generates
//                        (either a release-time classification or a
//                        hold-detected long-click). Cleared when the press
//                        produces its event, or by clearButtonQueue() /
//                        resetState() so a release we didn't see the press
//                        for is ignored.
//   lastRelease_         edge-time of the most recent release
//   firstClickRelease_   edge-time of the first release in this sequence
//   clickCount_          releases accumulated, not yet emitted
//
// Output flags (cleared at the top of every poll, set when an event emits):
//   shortClick_, doubleClick_, tripleClick_, quadClick_, longClick_
//
// Time fields are all milliseconds. Edge times come from the ISR's
// esp_timer_get_time()/1000; the trailing-silence check uses millis().
// Both are the same clock domain (since boot), just different read paths.
//
// Flow:
//   1. Clear last poll's output flags.
//   2. Snapshot the ISR queue head (so we don't chase a moving target),
//      then drain entries [tail, head):
//        - Reject edges within DEBOUNCE_MS of the last accepted change.
//        - Reject edges that don't actually flip stablePressed_.
//        - On a down-edge: record pressStart_, arm the press.
//        - On an up-edge that's armed:
//            * duration >= LONG_MS  -> emit longClick_, reset clickCount_
//            * else                 -> clickCount_++, remember releases
//   3. After draining, if a press is still held past LONG_MS, emit
//      longClick_ now and clear pressArmed_ so the eventual release is
//      ignored. This is the normal path for long-click emission.
//   4. After draining, if a click sequence is pending, commit it when ANY of:
//        - gap elapsed:      now - lastRelease_      > MAX_CLICK_GAP_MS
//        - sequence timeout: now - firstClickRelease_ > MAX_CLICK_SEQUENCE_MS
//        - count >= 4:       quad commits immediately (nothing it could become)
//      Then map clickCount_ to shortClick_ / doubleClick_ / tripleClick_ /
//      quadClick_ and reset.
