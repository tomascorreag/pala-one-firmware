//  The currently open book and where the user is looking at it. Shared
//  between `ReaderScreen` (active reading session) and
//  `BookmarkPreviewScreen` (transient view before commit). Both screens
//  legitimately operate on a `BookView`; only the reader does anything
//  beyond view (auto-save throttle, idle prefetch, wake arming) — those
//  live private inside `reader.cpp`.
//
//  Strong invariant: a book is "open" iff `book.isOpen()` returns true,
//  and that's true iff `book.path()` is non-empty. The file handle, path,
//  and derived NVS key always move as a unit through `OpenBook`'s methods.
//
//  Library / upload / web flows fully clear `g_bookview` on leaving the
//  reader (see `LibraryScreen::onEnter`), so non-reader code never has to
//  reason about stale book state.
